# MatLab
This repo contains MATLAB codes from my academic coursework, including root finding methods, projectile motion analysis, mass defect and binding energy calculations, binding energy curve plotting, and basic nuclear engineering problems. Useful for learning numerical methods and nuclear physics concepts.
